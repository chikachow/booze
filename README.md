# Booze

A private wine-cellar catalogue for finding, adding, moving, and consuming physical bottles from a phone. Wines and vintages hold shared facts; bottles hold individual facts and positions. Photo capture assists entry, with uncertain results kept for human review.

## Development

Use Node 24 and the pnpm version pinned in `package.json`.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --filter @chikachow/booze-web exec wrangler d1 migrations apply booze --local
pnpm --filter @chikachow/booze-web dev --host 127.0.0.1
```

Local D1 and R2 state lives in `apps/web/.wrangler`. Keep it when restarting development. Local authentication works only on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` when `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` is absent. Photo extraction requires the configured AI gateway and its credential; manual bottle entry works without them.

For Clerk development, configure `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in `apps/web/.env.local` and Worker secrets in `apps/web/.dev.vars`. These files are ignored by Git. Production setup and data recovery are described in [deployment](docs/deployment.md).

```sh
pnpm check
pnpm --filter @chikachow/booze-web build
```

The checks include migrated SQLite tests, React interaction tests, generated-theme validation, and Chrome browser tests in light and dark modes. Browser tests require Google Chrome and reserve port 4174. The build checks client bundle budgets.

D1 is the source of truth. R2 stores images and extraction artifacts. Cloudflare Workflows coordinates extraction retries. The browser and MCP use the same site roles: owner, editor, and viewer.
